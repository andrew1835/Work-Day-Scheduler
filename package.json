  "description": "## What, Why, and HOW With this assignment, I was motivated to use my new skills with React in order to recreate my portfolio with React. It was a really useful assignment. It helped me hone the react skill I've gained over the past couple weeks, and it was cool to see how the same portfolio could be rendered with React as opposed to HTML. I'm sure it also looks more impressive to potential employers as well.   To achieve the end result, I: 1. Created a new react app  2. Pseudo coded so that I knew how to set up my files/folders 3. Created all the correct components and pages and linked them up 4. Put it all together in the PorfolioContainer file, which was exoported to the App.js file, which is then displayed by virtue of the index.js file",
